# Currency Converter

## Getting started
To use this app, run on a terminal "python main.py"
Uses a Python [framework](https://thepythoncode.com/article/currency-converter-gui-using-tkinter-python) for a UI interaction. [Tkinter = In professional settings, it’s generally accepted to pronounce it as “Tee-kay-inter.”]

## Suggested Approach
Notes from Shahzad :
* Create Git reporsitory
* Clone the repo
* Go into the folder in VScode
* Create virtual environment
* Create main.py
* Install Requests (python -m pip install requests)
* Install DOTENV
* Install pip install requests-mock
* Start coding in main.py
* Then modularize
* Write small functions one by one
* Test as needed and able
* Add needed entries to .gitignore
* Create the requirements.txt
* Code and test to get the api data for initial testing
* Think on how to get the input for the API data from user and call the function.
