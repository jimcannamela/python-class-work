# Project A

## Objective:

    Develop a command-line application that converts an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.

## Features:

    1. Currency conversion: Allow users to convert an amount from one currency to another.

    2. Real-time Exchange rates: Fetch the latest exchange rates from an online API
    
    3. Input Validation: ensure that user inputs are valid (e.g., correct currency codes, valid amounts)
    
    4. Error handling: Properly handle errors, such as network problems, or user input errors.
    
    5. Hint: you will need to use the requests module to make the API call, and the json module to parse the response.
    
    6. Hint: regular expressions can be used to help validate currency codes, and try-except blocks can catch conversion errors for amounts.
