# Project B

## Objective:

    Develop a command-line application that provides weather forecasts for different cities using an external weather API. Implement this application following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

## Features:

    1. Fetch Weather: The application should allow users to enter a name of a city and retrieve the current weather forecast for that location.
    
    2. Display results: show the weather forecast information clearly and concisely
    
    3. Error handling: properly handle potential errors, such as invalid city names or issues with the weather API
    
    4. Test Cases: Develop comprehensive test cases covering all functionalities.
    
    5. Hint: Use a testing framework - follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
    
    6. For each feature or functionality, write one or more tests before writing the code.
    
    7. Run tests frequently to ensure they pass and the application behaves as expected.

## Improvements:

    Extend the application to provide a 5-day forecast or hourly forecasts.

    Allow users to choose units of measurement(e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit)
