'''
Project A
Objective:
Build a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Features:

Calculator should be able to handle two numbers at a time.
The user should be prompted to enter two numbers and the operation they want to perform
The calculator should display the result of the operation
After displaying the result, the calculator should ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.
The application should handle basic error checking, such as division by zero and input validation.
Hints:

Each arithmetic operation can be a function
Write a function that prompts the user to input two numbers and ensure these are valid numbers
you may use tryâ€¦ except block to handle exceptions and validate the input
Implement a loop to allow the user to keep using the calculator without restarting the script
Improvements:

Allow calculator to handle floating-point numbers
Extend the calculator with more operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root, modulus, etc..)
