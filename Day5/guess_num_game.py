# input() function is used to take input from the user.

# Guess a number game

# THis program will allow the user to select a number in a given range
# The program will then generate a random number in the that range.

# the user will try to guess this number
# after each guess, the program will provide clues indicating whether
# the guess was too high or too low.

# what is my data? - int
# how can I take that data to generate a random number?
            # query on google: how to generate a random number in python

# how can I continously run the program until the user guesses the correct number? - YES while loop or some kind of loop - until certain condition is met
